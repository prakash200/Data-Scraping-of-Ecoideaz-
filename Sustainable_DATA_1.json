This was because most of us are unaware that the hills and valleys of Arunachal Pradesh too, grow this fruit. Though the fruit was grown in abundance here, Kiwi farmers are unable to explore its full potential as a raw fruit in terms of market and price. Most of it was left to rot in the ground or fed to animals, as a result, most of the Kiwi orchards were abandoned by the farmers.
