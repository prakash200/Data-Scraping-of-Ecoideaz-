The association was primarily set up to promote organic farming, lobby with government agencies and departments to pay more attention to sustainable agriculture and assist farmers using chemicals and pesticides to convert successfully to organic farming methods. While the association has formulated programmes to assist organic farmers with organic certification and also participates fully in the Participatory Guarantee System (PGS) of organic certification designed mostly for small and marginal farmers, it has steadfastly resisted becoming an agent for the procurement and distribution of organic produce. It prefers instead to promote and support individuals, communities, NGOs, and networks who are in the business of organic marketing. Organic Farming Association of India today remains the only membership-based national association of organic farmers, organic farming promoters and green stores. By charter, the President of the association will always be an organic farmer. The association will also strive to ensure gender equality in all its activities. It campaigns actively against the introduction of genetically modified organisms and seeds in India\u2019s agriculture.",

Then we add a little amount of pure curd into the desi cow milk. In some hours that added curd turns the whole milk into the curd. After that, we mix desi cow\u2019s curd by Bilona process. While beating the curd, hot or cold water, supported the season, is added to the curd. (In wintertime, warm water is employed and within the summertime, cold water is employed to churn the curd) By hand churning method (not via motor), pure butter is produced. Then the butter is extracted from it in another container.Then the Desi cow\u2019s butter is heated during a clay pot over a dung fire at low flame. By boiling the butter, ghee is a produced feature a very nice aroma and yellow in color. It\u2019s very pleasant in taste also. The color and taste is predicated on the heating period and quality of the milk. This process isn't only lengthy but also costlier too. It takes 30 to 32 liters of milk to organize 1 KG of Bilona Ghee.",

The principal guidelines for organic production are to use materials and practices that enhance the ecological balance of natural systems and that integrate the parts of the farming system into an ecological whole. In other words, Organic farming uses eco-friendly agricultural practices to produce crop in order to retain and save nature in all means, i.e. by not using any environmentally harmful chemicals and fertilizers.Nemani Industries Pvt.

                "DESCRIPTION": "Established in the year 2014, Tunwal E-Vehicle had a mission to replace all the gasoline operated bike on the road. It aimed at making the country greener by developing and providing environment-friendly means of commutation to people. Tunwal promises to provide the most cutting-edge technology and the best design and comfort to its customers. The company has set high standards of affordable eco-friendly technology in the market. Being one of the best e-bike manufacturers in India, Tunwal E-Vehicle offers a number of benefits to its customers.Long Battery LifeTunwal E-Vehicles offers different classes of E-Bikes such as Storm ZA, Electrika 48, Mini Sport 63, Mid Sport 63, Lithino-Li and SuperSport 63. All these offerings have a long battery life. The batteries of the bikes take around five to seven hours on an average to charge fully. On a single charge, the vehicle is capable of running for around 75 km to 150 km, which is pretty high when compared to industry standards. In fact, Electrika 48 is capable of running 85 and 140 km per charge, the highest in the industry.Anti-theft AlarmThis is one of the major pluses in Tunwal E-Bikes. To keep your bikes safe, the company has pre-installed an anti-theft alarm in each model. Whenever a thief tries to take your vehicle away, the rear wheel of the bike will get automatically locked and an alarm will be ticked to alert the owner of the vehicle. This is the differentiating feature of the vehicles of the company.No License RequiredAnother plus of riding Tunwal E-Bikes is that you don\u2019t need a driving license for it. As per the present law of India, any motor vehicle which moves at less than 25 km of speed and has less than 250 watts of power been exempted from having a driving license. Hence this reduces an added burden on the user of the vehicle.Undercharge and Overcharge ProtectionTunwal E-Vehicle uses 60V, 40 Ah Lithium and 12 V, 62 Ah Lead Acid batteries in their vehicles. Both of these offers complete protection from fluctuation in voltage. Accidental incidences of undercharging and overcharging are taken care of. The charger of the batteries comes with smart sensors which are capable of determining the current level of charge and then regulate it accordingly.Fewer Maintenance HasslesLike any other electric vehicle, Tunwal E-Bikes too are free of any maintenance hassles. You can save approximately Rs. 25,000 that is needed for regular maintenance of the conventional bikes. This makes them highly pocket-friendly.Charging PointLithino-Li of Tunwal comes with a USB port for mobile charging. The location of this point offers an added advantage. Usually, this point is provided in the seat of the vehicles which is risky as well as inconvenient.

It removes impurities and reduces Nitrogen by using effective biological process. The solution is echo-friendly, easy to install and low-maintenance. You don\u2019t need tertiary treatment mechanism which makes it cost-effective. KLARO is an excellent solution for the needs sewage treatment needs of all magnitudes.MEDIA FILTER: Suspended physical impurities and contamination in the water can be effectively removed by passing it through the layers of several sizes and varieties of media, e.g. sand, gravel, pebbles, and anthracite. These filters are excellent for removing organic material, clay, silic,a and turbidity. We are the leading provider of world-class media-based filters (Quartz-Sand, Silica-Sand, Anthracite, Garnet, Coal, etc.); suitable for widespread domestic and industrial applications.REVERSE OSMOSIS PLANT: When the water contains a large amount of dissolved contaminators, no other technique than the Reverse Osmosis is effective. We bring highly effective RO solution that uses high-pressure pump and a semi-permeable membrane. When the water moves through the membrane with high pressure, only pure water molecules pass through, and impurities get filtered, resulting in crystal-clean, 100% pure water.WATER SOFTENER: Excess quantity of Magnesium and Calcium ions increase the hardness of the water. It is not recommended for human consumption because of long-term effects. Also, it causes erosion in the pressure boilers and RO systems. Hard water affects the quality of washing in laundries and other applications. Our water softening solutions reduce the hardness and makes is suitable for domestic and industrial use by using sophisticated Sodium Resin technique.",

Our design approach is human-centred and we are committed to maintaining the highest standards; constantly and comprehensively evolving our field-tested design prototypes.Designing and developing products that provide economic farming solutions for micro-farms make up our core focus.Most technological innovations are targeted for the top 10% of the population. You will find this disparity everywhere \u2013 every few months a new cell phone hits the market, but how often do you hear anything being designed for farmers upon whom we depend for survival? Agriculture in India is oneof the worst hit sectors with this problem. While it still employs about 50% of our population, its contribution to GDP is significantly low at about 14%. Thoughthere are many reasons for this imbalance, the role of lacking agricultural innovations is something that should hit us hard because India has no dearth of engineers and designers.At Sickle Innovations, we strive to become the trusted companion for farmers and labourers across India; doing our bit to help make farming profitable and financially sustainable. Our mission is to develop innovative mechanisation solutions to improve conventional farming practices through Design-Thinking.",
