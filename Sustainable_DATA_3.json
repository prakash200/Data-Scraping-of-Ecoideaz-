Based in Leh the laid back capital of Ladakh, we specialize in leisure and adventure tours and have been offering the discerning traveler and trekker, excellent services for over two decades. Comprising a team of tour and adventure activity professionals, our objective has always been to offer well organized and hassle free holidays and treks to all our guests.Our well researched and time tested trek itineraries have been appreciated by many of our world wide clients who have often returned to explore more of our eco friendly tours. In 1995 we secured for the first time a permit for a small film crew to enter the Restricted Area of Nubra. They came back bubbling over with enthusiasm for a truly beautiful and undiscovered part of the Himalaya. In the late 90s we had groups who completed the trek and again came back with fabulous reports of the place and the people.Always concerned about the ecology of the area, and understanding the need for eco tourism in Ladakh, we at Moonlight Travels have often undertaken cleaning drives on trekking trails. In 2004, we organised a massive clean up programme around the Tso Moriri and Tsokar lake shores. We did this with the cooperation of ALTOA (All Ladakh Tour Operators Association). In 2005 we got together 24 members of the local travel operators association and 9 overseas visitors and again went on a cleaning drive around some of the more popular trekking trails. We seriously intend to continue this so that all our trekkers enjoy their treks without coming across garbage and other unwanted paraphernalia on our trails. We know that the Changthang wetlands and grass pastures need protection as the Changpa nomads depend entirely on the precious grass that grows on this extensive plateau.",

He spent over 12 years in mainstream tourism and realized that neither the rural community nor the environment is benefited by mainstream tourism.With this in mind, he started working with the villagers in a small village called Banavasi. It is the oldest town in Karnataka and has a history of 2000 years. Work started slowly and steadily on sustainable tourism, but it was not easy. The first year just went in winning the trust of the villagers. Later along with the villagers an alternative model was created where people from Urban areas, could come stay with the community and have a meaningful holiday.Kiran is a satisfied person today because his model worked and he has successfully engaged about 250 guests in this way. Corporate professionals, Students and international visitors have contributed immensely to make this a success. With these learnings, Kiran is in the process of starting another venture in Chickmagalur with much more impact to the community and environment.",

We realized that there were not enough peanut butters available in the Indian market that didn't have added oil, added sugar and so many other unnecessary ingredients that we still can't pronounce. So we took on the challenge - to come up with the perfect recipe for a great tasting, 100% natural peanut butter, from 100% natural ingredients.Only healthy ingredientsOnce you smell a jar of Happy Jars, you'll never go back to eating the other stuff.Each Happy Jar has more than 94% roasted peanuts, blended into a lovely creamy texture, great for spreading on toast and fruit, mixing in shakes, or just licking it straight out of the jar with a spoon.We've made sure we stay as far away from the unhealthy stuff as possible. We use jaggery as a sweetener for the Original Creamy & Crunchy jars. We're minimal with the quantity we use so it's the perfect food for the health conscious.Most store-bought brands use hydrogenated fats, oils and preservatives which makes the peanut butter last almost 1.5 years on the shelf! Nothing that stays for so long can be healthy. Happy Jars uses only the natural oils from inside the peanuts to blend them to a smooth creamy texture. They're 100% healthy, super tasty, and you'll finish a jar so fast that shelf life is not a problem!",

Approximately 21 million crafts people in India are dependent on their skills as primary sources of income. Cottage Industries, craft communities are unable to access economic opportunities, unable to sustain livelihoods, they now seek alternative professionals.Despite all above, we believe that handicraft is an important segment of the informal sector of our economy where approximately 21 million craftspeople subsist. We also believe tradition and development can go together by thinking creatively and providing adequate marketing opportunities.Apart from its importance in employment generation, the handicrafts sector has shown remarkable growth in recent years in exports, this earning valuable foreign exchange for our country.",

                "DESCRIPTION": "back2basics was founded by S. Madhusudhan, a self-confessed foodie with a passion for all things fresh, natural and healthy. An IIM-B alum and an advertising and marketing veteran, after working in leadership roles in many multi-national corporations across the globe, Madhu stopped to re-evaluate his own fast-paced lifestyle and food habits after a health scare.He soon realized that while Bangaloreans have access to many different varieties of fruits and vegetables, very few people are actually buying fresh produce grown using natural, sustainable methods. After personally witnessing his local vegetable vendor washing carrots using sewage water, Madhu decided it was time to make a change.And so back2basics was born. Madhu does not have any agricultural background - he last studied Botany in Class 10 - and started from humble beginnings by growing produce on a 30 ft x 40 ft plot. He spent a lot of time understanding both the challenges faced by the Indian farmer and those faced by the discerning Indian consumer with an appetite for fresh, high-quality fruits and vegetables. By applying several management techniques to improve current agricultural practices, back2basics is a unique blend of ancient wisdom and modern science.Today all our farms, spread across close to a hundred acres around Bangalore, boast of many local and exotic varieties of fruits, vegetables and greens, grown using world-class techniques and chemical-free inputs. Since they are all grown in our farms (as against purchased in markets or unknown sources) we are able to maintain high standards of uniformity & consistency in taste, colour, texture and finish.back2basics currently supplies produce to many reputed grocery chains, retailers, organic stores and gated communities in Bangalore. Our produce is also exported to organic retailers in many parts of the world.",

Farmers require high performing, non-chemical based crop protection products which will not only help them cultivate agri outputs which are free of pests and residues, but also boost agricultural yield significantly. Due to lack of effective, affordable and eco-friendly technologies to control pests, farmers are left with no choice but to continue spraying harmful and toxic pesticides on crops. This also leads to a large investment burden on these farmers and forces them to drift away from farming.With a humble start in 2011, Barrix Agro Sciences Private Limited, an innovative establishment, made its foray into the agricultural sector to touch and profoundly influence human lives. Eco-friendly crop protection methods are adopted and developed by Barrix with the latest technologies after performing in-depth study and research on products to support organic farming. This way Barrix has been able to provide innovative and effective products to farms. With positive reviews and wide acceptance emerging from the customers, Barrix looks at transforming pest control methodology. With a strong supply chain and dedicated personnel the company is marching towards impacting the society and ecology in a positive way.",

These plates are processed(organically) and manufactured from sheaths that fall-off naturally from Arecanut trees(otherwise mostly these sheaths go as waste)Taking advantage of Karnataka state' vast hectare space of Arecanut trees(Arecanut trees are maximum grown in our country in Karnataka, about 40% of hectare space in our country lies in Karnataka, mostly within the malnad region), Green Sense is committed to produce large quantities of Organic plates to meet the ever growing demand for use-and-throw plates and also at lower costsTo achieve the cost advantage, Green Sense believes in establishing communication and channels directly to those people who matter. Last two months, we have cut down unnecessary channels(like agents) who could help us procure Arecanut leaves(or sheaths) and also to sell our produce. We have established direct contacts with Farmers on one-end and with direct consumers on the other. This way cost of produce has been brought down. Well, we will continue to improve on this to lower the costs for us and eventually for our customersIndia being a land of mass events such as festivals, function, marriages, get-togethers, there is a large demand for use and throw plates in the market now. Plastic plates as we know do not degrade themselves in the environment and harmful to everyone around them(even with recent Government development about usage of >40 microns plastic, people continue to use harmful plastic). Paper plates usage results in serious deforestation, as it requires cutting down the trees to produce them. Unfortunately, vast population including the very educated ones, still continue to use plastic and paper plates during such mass events.Look at the characteristics of a Arecanut plate below:100% Eco-friendly. It is produced from falling leafs, that means not harming trees like other plates. Processed organically, no chemicals or harmful substances used100% Bio-degradable: Eat your food on these plates and throw them at a plant, it forms a good manure to the growing plantVery HygienicMicrowave-oven & Refrigerator safeVery Sturdy, can hold in on one hand to consume food, unlike other platesHold liquid too for few hoursCan be easily molded into different shapes and sizesThey are \"Wonder plates\"!! Aren't they?We are dedicated to do our bit in bringing in this awareness to the public. Hope you will do our bit too..As everyone says this mantra nowadays, \"Go Green\".. but lets not just say it, but do it \ud83d\ude42",

It did not take long for this hobby, which was largely catering to the needs of family and friends, to quickly grow into a full scale venture, largely encouraged by all who had tried my products.I make cold-processed soaps. I make them from scratch with oils and lye. No pre-manufactured or externally sourced soap bases. No carcinogenic and toxic chemicals like Triclosan, or other dioxins! The advantage of this method of soap-making is that it manages to keep most of the properties of the ingredients through the soap-making process, which in turn help in moisturizing your skin. It also retains 100% of the glycerine, which is a natural by-product of soap. Most commercial soap manufacturers remove the glycerine from the soaps and sell it as an independent product. Glycerine is a humectant, which basically means that it attracts moisture from the air thereby helping the skin stay soft and moisturized.",

Each sheet is hand coated by brush with great care to retain the grains on the surface. A little bit crushing of the sheet before coating helps in creating a leather finish. Metallic sheen is obtained by a similar process of brush coating. We specialise in the silk laid varieties where strands of silk are embedded on each sheet by an intricate process.

From its beginning stages, this movement embraced action oriented working plan. We operationalised our work focussing on connecting schools and farmers directly to create farms in schools, taking uncultivated land for lease with support of schools and farmers, preserving seed varieties through harvest of indigenous varieties etc.That is not to mention the initial year of travel we undertook to understand the mostly undocumented indigenous farming methods and seed varieties in our land. We took our study and connections we made and have continued farming- growing rice and vegetables for nearly seven years now, along with our social outreach activities. Now as we look out from the safety and strength of our relationship in its fullness with the soil, we feel we should reach out, so that the voice of the farmer- young and old is heard together. And thus we are at a significant part in our journey of brining out a magazine which we feel further spread the power of this movement through the power of written word.Come join us in making Kerala the first food sovereign state in India.
