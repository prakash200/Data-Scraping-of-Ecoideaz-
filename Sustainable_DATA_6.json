We wanted mats and props to reflect and value the peaceful principles that yoga embodies; one of which is to establish perfect harmony with nature. Taking inspiration from some wonderful international eco-yoga brands and from the make-in-India campaign, we launched our first made-in-India natural mat-over.The very first mat was made of jute and natural rubber, thus the name JURU. It was our eureka moment and it came around Jan 2014. We had discovered an alternate solution to stinky and cheap PVC yoga Mats. Instead of crying Eureka we cried JURU! We were pleased to know that the word Juru (in a foreign language) is also an exclamation to celebrate a pleasant discovery. And this is precisely what JURU is \u2013 a perfect yoga companion for yogis who wish to choose the eco-friendly path.JURU has grown from being a product name to being a made-in-India yoga brand that strives to deliver innovative, comfortable and trending eco-friendly yoga mats, props and accessories made from unique and sustainable resources like cork, jute, natural rubber, cotton, etc., for yoga-lovers across the globe.We believe that JURU mats are not products of long hours of brainstorming and hard-work alone, but also of love, built to celebrate yoga\u2019s many triumphs, a gift from one yogi to another, a gift from a yogi to nature!",

Unlike plastic products that spoil earth, we have found a solution to safeguard the atmosphere by producing the disposable plates that degrade very soon leaving no pollution. These are the finest eco friendly plates on the earth that are manufactured from 100% natural and unique materials that are obtained in the most natural way.These areca leaf plates are made from the naturally fallen leaves of areca trees that grow in moderate temperatures. These leaves were considered to be wastes before a couple of decades and were thrown away. But we have found a way to make art from waste by making beautiful plates and soup bowls out of them. They are sold with India and are also exported worldwide.Different types of palm leaf plates are made to be used in different occasions and places such as noodles plate, pizza plate, cake plate, sauce plate, chicken tray, mutton tray, bread plate, bread tray, outdoor picnic plates, fish plate, soup cup, vegetable plate, curry tray, sweet tray, sauce bowls, fondue cups and many more.The areca leaves have found their value in all special occasions such as weddings, betrothal parties, get together parties, birthday parties, baby showers, ice breaking ceremonies and festivals. People prefer these areca plates as they are green friendly and easy to handle. They are thick but weightless and give you the feel of using wooden plates.There are so many positive aspects why people love these palm leaf plates over thermacool products or paper plates. Thermacool products are not destroyed naturally and emit poisonous gas on combustion. The paper plates are of course biodegradable but they are not sturdy to handle and they are manufactured by destroying millions of trees. Our areca leaf plates are manufactured by leaves of the trees that fall naturally in particular season and so no harm is done to the natural existence.These eco friendly plates are very easy to handle and serve. They do not bend or break very easily and so they are highly preferred in buffet dinners and parties. They have a neat and beautiful woody finish that they look like wooden plates. A food served in wooden plates really adds glamour to the special occasion in which they are used and so they are welcomed by people all over the world.Peak International has undertaken the noble venture of popularizing this product worldwide which so far was not known to the world outside India. We have a noble aim of creating a pollution free environment with biodegradable substances. We want these eco friendly plates to replace the harmful non-degradable materials in every household. So we offer them at highly affordable rates in neat and clean packing that would ensure only high quality products to reach your premises.",

It is effective within hours of dosing. Bio Nutrient contains micronutrients required for multiplication of the ubiquitous and beneficial Phytoplankton in any water body. Bio Nutrient contains Si, Fe, Mn, Ca, Mg, Zn, Cu, B, S, Mo, P,K and Co.With the use of Bio Nutrient, all polluted lakes and rivers can be restored without harming the water life,\u201d Besides cleaning water bodies, the product also has several other uses. Bio Nutrient can be used for growing phytoplankton in oceans to absorb carbon dioxide and reduce greenhouse effect, thereby aiding in solving the global warming problem. It can also be used for preventing growth of toxic algae species called red tides in the oceans. It can be used for generating plankton and live food in aquaculture ponds which can boost the growth of prawns and fish.Beyond large water bodies, Bio Nutrient can also be used for treating sewage water from a residential apartment complex as well. Typically, sewage from a complex of 50 houses would be about 25,000 liters per day (100 liters per person). 1 ml of Bio Nutrient can be applied to 1000 gallons of water once a week. Shake the bottle well before dosing. Dosing should be done early at sunrise when Phytoplankton are most active.Bio Nutrient has been tested to be non-toxic as per APHA (2012) and OECD (1992). Bio Nutrient has no impact on humans and is even safe if small amounts are consumed accidentally. Overdosing will cause excess Phytoplankton and water will turn brown. Beneficial bacteria, zooplankton and fish grow in a healthy manner in ponds and lakes when dosed with Bio Nutrient.",

Significant activities have picked up for its production especially with a view to reduce the huge cost involved in import of Petroleum fuel and to take care of the shortage of Petrodiesel anticipated within a few years from now. In addition, the process of production of Biodiesel from non edible vegetable oil will boost the rural economy and providing non-polluting, bio degradable and safe environment.Considering all the aspects available among non-edible Tree Bearing Oil (TBO) seeds, Jatropha curcas has been identified as the most suitable seed for extraction of oil and subsequent processing of Biodiesel. The best source of producing Biodiesel is Jatropha curcas, a plant that grows well mainly in tropical climate. Jatropha can be grown in arid zones (20 cm rainfall) as well as higher rainfall zones and even on land with thin soil cover.In tropical countries like ours, Jatropha grows well and can bloom and produce fruit through out the year. To withstand extreme drought conditions, Jatropha plant sheds leaves to conserve moisture which may result in reduced growth. Although, Jatropha is adapted to soils with low fertility and alkalinity, better yields can be obtained on poor quality soils, if fertilizers containing small amount of nutrients are used for the first two years.India produces only 22% of its diesel requirement & 78% is imported at a huge cost in foreign currency. With the introduction of compulsory use of 10-20% Biodiesel in UK, USA, France, Germany, Japan & other countries who specifies a 40-50% mix by 2010. India has a huge requirement by 2010 to meet the world norms & emission standard & accordingly a National policy has already been given a green signal by Govt. of India in the year 2003.

Indian Railways have taken a decision to plant Jatropha trees by the side of railway tracks & Indian Oil other agencies in possession of Biodiesel Processing Units will eventually process the Jatropha oil into biodiesel for Indian Railways & to meet the national needs.",
